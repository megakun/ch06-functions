# Exercise 2: writing and executing functions (II)

# Write a function `CompareLength` that takes in 2 vectors, and returns the sentence:
# "The difference in lengths is N"
CompareLength <- function(L1, L2){
  diff<- abs(length(L1) - length(L2))
  diff.string <- paste('The difference in lengths is', diff)
  return (diff.string)
}

# Pass two vectors of different length to your `CompareLength` function
CompareLength(c(1,2,3), 1:100)

# Write a function `DescribeDifference` that will return one of the following statements:
# "Your first vector is longer by N elements"
# "Your second vector is longer by N elements"
DescribeDifference <- function(L1, L2){
  if(length(L1) > length(L2)){
    diff <- length(L1) - length(L2)
    
    diff.string <- paste("Your first vector is longer by ", diff ," elements")
  }else{
    diff <-  length(L2) - length(L1)
    diff.string <- paste("Your second vector is longer by ", diff ," elements")
  }
  return (diff.string)
}

# Pass two vectors to your `DescribeDifference` function
DescribeDifference(c(1,2,3), 1:100)

### Bonus ###

# Rewrite your `DescribeDifference` function to tell you the name of the vector which is longer
